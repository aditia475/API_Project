# Use automated tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for APIs and to collect information about them, such as endpoint URLs, parameters, and HTTP methods.

# Use manual testing techniques, such as fuzzing and parameter manipulation, to identify any hidden or undocumented APIs.

# Analyze API documentation to identify any additional APIs that were missed during the automated and manual testing.

# Conduct security testing on each API to identify any vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

# Test API authentication mechanisms to ensure they are secure and cannot be bypassed.

# Analyze network traffic to identify any additional APIs that may be exposed.

# Verify that all discovered APIs adhere to secure coding practices, such as input validation and output sanitization.

# Review the results of the API discovery and testing to identify any gaps or areas for improvement.

# Document the API discovery and testing process, including any vulnerabilities identified and recommendations for remediation.
